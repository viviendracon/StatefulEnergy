# StatefulEnergy
Stateful energy systems are an emerging paradigm in which energy is stored by creating and maintaining highly ordered quantum states, effectively “charging” a material by reducing its entropy. By later allowing a controlled return to disorder, the stored energy can be released as useful work.
